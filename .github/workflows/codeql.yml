# This GitHub Actions workflow is designed to run CodeQL analysis on your repository.
# CodeQL is a powerful semantic code analysis engine that helps find security vulnerabilities.
#
# The workflow is triggered on:
# - Push events to the 'main' branch
# - Pull requests targeting the 'main' branch
# - A scheduled cron job that runs every Monday at midnight
#
# The workflow consists of a single job named 'analyze' which runs on the latest Ubuntu runner.
# It has the following steps:
# 1. Harden Runner: Uses the 'step-security/harden-runner' action to enhance the security of the runner.
# 2. Checkout repository: Uses the 'actions/checkout' action to check out the repository's code.
# 3. Initialize CodeQL: Uses the 'github/codeql-action/init' action to initialize CodeQL with the specified languages.
# 4. Autobuild: Uses the 'github/codeql-action/autobuild' action to automatically build the code if necessary.
# 5. Perform CodeQL Analysis: Uses the 'github/codeql-action/analyze' action to perform the actual CodeQL analysis.
#
# The workflow is configured to analyze JavaScript and Ruby code. You can modify the 'language' matrix
# to include other supported languages as needed.
#
# For more information on CodeQL and its language support, visit: https://aka.ms/codeql-docs/language-support
#
# For most projects, this workflow file will not need changing; you simply need
# to commit it to your repository.
#
# You may wish to alter this file to override the set of languages analyzed,
# or to provide custom queries or build logic.
#
# ******** NOTE ********
# We have attempted to detect the languages in your repository. Please check
# the `language` matrix defined below to confirm you have the correct set of
# supported CodeQL languages.
